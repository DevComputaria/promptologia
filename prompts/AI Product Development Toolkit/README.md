As I use different AI tools I often find myself designing specific prompts to get desired outputs. This repository is my way of:

*   **Organizing:** Keeping track of prompts that work well.
*   **Reusing:** Quickly finding and adapting prompts for new tasks.
*   **Sharing:** Making useful prompts available (primarily for myself, but maybe helpful to others!).
*   **Learning:** Refining prompts over time and seeing patterns in what works.

## Guided Conversational Approach

What makes these prompts unique is their **user-centered, guided conversational design**:

*   **Interactive Process:** Rather than one-shot prompting, these templates guide AI models through an iterative conversation with you.
*   **Structured Questioning:** The AI asks targeted questions focused on specific aspects of your project, building a comprehensive document piece by piece.
*   **User Confirmation Checkpoints:** The prompts explicitly instruct the AI to verify its understanding and direction with you before moving to new sections or making significant interpretations.
*   **Contextual Analysis:** Many templates use inputs from previous steps (like a PRD for context plus an MVP concept), instructing the AI to cross-reference information for consistency.
*   **Adaptive Guidance:** The templates help you think through aspects you might have missed, while allowing you to maintain control over the final direction.
